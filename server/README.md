# 15-minute City Backend

This backend is used as API for retrieving data. It's written with Flask combined with sqlite3 database. 

## Using docker
You can simply run the backend using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
Run these commands from `.../server/` directory:
<br />
```
docker build --tag 15-minute-city .
docker run --publish 3001:5000 15-minute-city
```
<br />

## Preparing environment
To run server, you have to install all dependencies:
### `pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br />

## Running server
Go to `source` directory and simply run `server.py` script:
### `python server.py`
<br />


## Debugging backend
By default server runs in production mode. If something wrong happens, you can try running it in debug mode to get more details with this command:
### `flask --app server --debug run --host=localhost --port 3001`
<br />
